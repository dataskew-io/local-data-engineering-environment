## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### Data Loading & Transformation

```python
# dlt pipeline with DuckDB destination and schema management
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="local_data",
    destination="duckdb",
    dataset_name="my_data"
)

# Data loading with transformations and quality checks
def load_csv_with_transformations():
    df = pd.read_csv("data/sample.csv")
    df['total_revenue'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']
    df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
    return df.to_dict(orient="records")
```

### Analytics & SQL Queries with Schema Handling

```sql
-- Proper schema-aware queries
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    SUM(total_revenue) as total_revenue
FROM my_data.sample_data
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
```

### Data Quality Monitoring

- Null value detection
- Duplicate record identification
- Business rule validation (positive quantities, prices)
- Date range validation
- Data type validation

## 📊 Analytics Capabilities

The workflow demonstrates:

1. **Summary Statistics**: Overall dataset metrics with revenue calculations
2. **Category Analysis**: Sales performance by product category
3. **Regional Analysis**: Geographic performance breakdown
4. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Comprehensive validation and reporting
5. **Automated Export**: CSV generation for all analysis results
